# SQLAlchemy--challenge
In part 1 of this challenge, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
In part 2 of the challenge, I desgined a Flask API based on the queries that I had developed.

I would like to mention that I had the help of AI and a totur.
